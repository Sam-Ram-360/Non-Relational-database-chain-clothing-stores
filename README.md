# Non-Relational-database-chain-clothing-stores


I have uploaded the layout of the collections for a chain clothing store in a NoSQL system using MongoDB database, along with some example JSON queries. The collection layout provides an overview of how the data is within the database, and the JSON queries demonstrate how to interact with the data.

To access the collection layout and JSON queries, please navigate to the repository. Once there, you will find a file containing the layout of the collections, which outlines the organization of data for entities like customers, products, and orders.

Furthermore, you will find a separate file containing example JSON queries. These queries are designed to retrieve specific data from the collections.

Feel free to explore the collection layout and the JSON queries to gain a better understanding of the database structure and how to interact with the data stored in MongoDB.

If you have any further questions or need any assistance, please don't hesitate to let me know.
